# Table of Contents and Course Goals

Hands-on *machine learning* (7.5 hours + 7.5 hours with Prof. Gallinucci)

- *Theory*, *practice*, and *case studies* of the main steps of the CRISP-DM methodology
  - We will have coding labs
  - Python libraries for machine learning (mainly `pandas` and `scikit-learn`)

Goals

1. *Master the right terms and paradigms* behind AI
1. *Develop (=code) your own (simple) project* based on AI
1. *Make technical considerations* about AI
    - "What happens if I do ...?"
1. *Understanding the surrounding AI world*
    - Make decisions with AI
    - Try to make predictions about AI for your company
    - Orient yourself in an extremely dynamic and complex world dominated by AI

# Teaching material

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

Slides and Python notebooks (to be opened on Google Colab) are sufficient to prepare for the final exam

Download the material from [https://github.com/w4bo/2025-bbs-dm](https://github.com/w4bo/2025-bbs-dm)

However, I suggest you to read the book:

- *Title*: Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow
- *Author*: Aurélien Géron
- Some notes about the book:
    - The book is intended as a support
    - The book is available for free in the library
    - The book is pretty huge (about 800 pages)
    - Carefully check the summary and select our topics
    - If you want, you can read the other parts to take inspiration (not requested for the final exam)
