# Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence

- The development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data
- ... and generalize to unseen data and thus perform tasks without explicit (coding) instructions

# Classical Programming vs Machine Learning

# A Simple Example: Calculator

Create a calculator that computes the sum of two numbers

**T**ask: $Z = X + Y$

# Classical Programming

# Machine Learning

(Supervised) Machine learning is usually divided into two steps:

- Train with **E**xperience (training set)
- Generalize to unseen data (test set) and evaluate the **P**erformance
- Training and test sets are not overlapping (they do not share the same data)

# Training the model

**E**xperience: training data

# Testing the Model

**P**erformance: checking accurate predictions
