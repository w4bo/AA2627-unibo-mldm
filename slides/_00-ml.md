# Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence

- The development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data
- ... and generalize to unseen data and thus perform tasks without explicit (coding) instructions

> **Machine Learning** [@mitchell1997machine] is the study of algorithms that
>
> - Improve their performance $P$
> - At some task $T$
> - With experience $E$
> - A well-defined learning task is given by $<P, T, E>$

# Classical Programming vs Machine Learning

![Classical Programming](./img/00-ml/ml1.svg)

# A Simple Example: Calculator

Create a calculator that computes the sum of two numbers

**T**ask: $Z = X + Y$

# Classical Programming

# Machine Learning

(Supervised) Machine learning is usually divided into two steps:

- Train with **E**xperience (training set)
- Generalize to unseen data (test set) and evaluate the **P**erformance
- Training and test sets are not overlapping (they do not share the same data)

# Training the model

**E**xperience: training data

# Testing the Model

**P**erformance: checking accurate predictions

# Taxonomy of Machine Learning

Machine Learning

- **Supervised Learning**: models are trained using labeled data to learn a mapping from inputs to labels
- **Unsupervised Learning**: algorithms find patterns, structures, and insights in unlabeled data without predefined answers
- **Reinforcement Learning**: an agent learns to make optimal decisions by interacting with a dynamic environment through trial-and-error

# Taxonomy of Machine Learning

Machine Learning

- *Supervised Learning*: models are trained using labeled data to learn a mapping from inputs to *labels*
    - **Classification**: the label is nominal; spam detection (`yes`/`no`), diagnosis (`healthy`/`sick`)
    - **Regression**: the label is continuous; house price, temperature
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

# Classification: Model-Based Methods

Model-based methods learn an explicit model from the training data.

Training

* Learn decision boundaries to generalize well to unseen data

  A(Training Data) --> B[Model Learning]
  B --> C(Trained Model)
```

```
 ──▶ Model Learning ──▶ Trained Model
```

Testing

* Use the trained model to make predictions on new data
* Compare predictions to ground truth for performance evaluation


```
Test Data ──▶ Trained Model ──▶ Predictions
                                        |
                                        ▼
                Ground Truth ──▶ Performance Evaluation
```

## Classification: Instance-Based Methods

Instance-based methods make predictions by comparing new inputs to stored training examples.

Characteristics:

* No explicit training phase
* Rely on similarity or distance measures
* Can be sensitive to noise and data size

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

```
New Point (x) ──▶ Find k closest neighbors ──▶ Majority vote among neighbors ──▶ Predicted class
```
